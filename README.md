Investigation of the performance of the EPF toolbox model with NGBoost Model
This is the repository for the investigation on the performance by different models on various datasets provided by the free open-access library called as EPFtoolbox. 
This repository contains the experiments on different datasets using different models. We already have the forecasted values on LEAR and DNN model provided by the EPFToolbox. Apart from that, we have all the datasets used for forecasting. 
Contains 4 notebooks.
PJM_NGBOOST: This is the notebook for PJM dataset using NGBoost model.
NP_NGBoot: This is the notebook for NordPool dataset using NGBoost
FR_NGBoost: This is the notebook for French dataset using NGBoost
Evaluation: This is the notebook for evaluating the models for different datasets.
